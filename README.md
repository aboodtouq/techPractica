## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### 1. Always Keep Your Branch Updated

Before starting development or building the project, make sure your branch is up to date:

```bash
# Commit or stash your changes
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Save progress"  # or use git stash if not ready to commit

# Switch to master and pull latest updates
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Switch back to your branch
git checkout your-branch-name

# Merge master into your branch
git merge master

# Resolve conflicts if any, then commit
```

### 2. Running with Docker

The project uses Docker for easy environment setup.

To start the services, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start all necessary containers in detached mode.
